"""Telegram bridge for a Gas City external-messaging adapter.

Carries turns between Telegram and a Gas City agent, and nothing else. It does
not decide what a change should be, which section it affects, or whether an
edit is safe — the agent's prompt owns all of that. The bridge's only judgment
is which human to ask, which it reads from responsibilities.json.

Protocol (verified against the generated OpenAPI spec, not the connected-clients
guide, which documents a register/SSE-subscribe surface this build does not
have):

  POST /v0/city/{city}/extmsg/adapters   register, with a callback_url
  POST /v0/city/{city}/extmsg/inbound    deliver a human turn to the agent
  POST <callback_url>/publish            Gas City delivers the agent's reply here
  GET  /v0/city/{city}/events/stream     workflow lifecycle, for phase cues

Replies arrive by callback, so there is no polling loop.

Traffic that belongs to a factory project — its conversation is the rig name —
is handed to the FactoryRouter, which owns desks, topics, and the rule that a
person may only speak when an agent is waiting on them. The landing-page flow
below remains for DMs no project is waiting on. The router is enabled by
PROJECT_STATE_DIR.
